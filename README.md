# Training a deep-learning classifier for aerial top view detection of vehicles

**CODE TO FOLLOW...**

## Overview

Deep learning approaches have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in various computer vision tasks such as object detection and recognition. In this repository I provide code and details on how to develop and train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect top-view vehicles from UAV footage.
